Code developed for Computers Laboratory (LCOM).

## Project
	
	
An obstacle course developped in C for LCOM (Computers Laboratory).

The point of the game is for the player to avoid the obstacles and collect points. By bumping into a rock, hole or street cone, lives are lost and by collecting coins, points are added to the score.
The car can be controlled through the keyboard ('w' for up and 's' for down) or by the mouse (positive movement along the y axis to move up and negative movements along the y axis to move down). The keys allow for switching lanes instantly, while using the mouse allows for a gradual movement between them.

>Main Menu

The main menu allows for choosing to play the game or exiting the program. The buttons are chosen through the mouse.
